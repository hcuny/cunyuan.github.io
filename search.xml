      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Initially the budget function aims to find the relation between sale data and “labor goal”, my first thought is to do linear regression without any transformation.First take a look at the scatter plot of all data points.Plot regression forms on each store, note that logically speaking budget function is designed for each store. The question will follow that how to judge if the linear regression really works? I.e., is a linear relationship between X and y justified?]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. Why SamplingA misconception I used to have is that the era of big data means the end of a need for sampling, actually, in a Big Data project, like the Bosch production line performance prediction, our models are still developed and piloted with samples. More generally speaking, to understand a statistical task, most times we have to design experiments which will inevitably use sampling.A sample is drawn with the goal of measuring something(with a sample statistic), or modeling something with a statistical/machine learning model. Much of classical statistics is concerned with making inference from small samples to populations: we do that by constructing Statistic, i.e. function of sample data to measure different features of population. Naturally we need to analyze sampling distribution, it refers to the distribution of some Sample Statistic. 2. Supporting TheoremLLWCLT 3. Magic – The BootstrapThink about this: you got 2 samples s1 &amp; s2 with the same size, they have the same point estimate of population mean, but std(s1)&gt;&gt;std(s2), how would you judge the accuracy of the point estimation? Obviously, you will trust s2 more. That is why bootstrap sampling works, it’s actually extracting as much information as possible from the sample.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Number of Data Points to Estimate?Overall, it’s very well normal-shaped, with a little bit “long tail”.1sns.distplot(df_demand['actual_sales'].values,bins=100) But divided them into stores, take first 5 as example, we’ll find their shape has a lot variation. Now think about our logic: we’re not assuming the actual-sale value is normally distributed, which is a too strong assumption. Instead, we’re assuming the “error of plan”: (actual_sale - manager_prediction) is normally distributed for each store. Wonderful, it’s just beautiful as we expected. And also take a look at the error of the first 5 stores.123for i in list(set(df_demand['storeid'].values))[:5]: value=df_demand[df_demand['storeid']==i]['diff'].values sns.distplot(value,bins=20) Here we comes the question: how many data points is adequate to estimate distribution? The rule of thumb is the more data you have, the better. In most cases, to get reliable distribution fitting results, you should have at least 75-100 data points available. It seems that to cluster stores will be necessary. Density EstimationKDE will be our tool for this task. Take a look at what the cdf will look like.12df_demand['diff']=df_demand['actual_sales']-df_demand['sales_manageradj']sns.kdeplot(df_demand['diff'].values, cumulative=True) Use scipy to calculate the CDF value for a certain point given the kde.1234v=10000X=np.array(df_demand['actual_sales'].values)gkde=stats.gaussian_kde(X)gkde.integrate_box_1d(0,v)]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Some concepts that look similar may lead to confusion, especially when given their abbreviations. This article will try to distinguish OLS, GLS, WLS, LARS, ALS 1. OLS - Ordinary Least Square No Comment. 2. GLS - Generalized Least SquareHere we’re not assuming errors are constant and uncorrelated, instead:Find S as the triangular matrix using the Choleski decomposition.(Square root of error covariance matrix), and reconstruct the regression function, to get constant &amp; uncorrelated error variance. 3. WLS - Weighted Least SquareA special case of GLS, errors are uncorrelated but have non-equal variance. 4. PLS - Partial Least SquareSame idea as PCR(Principle Component Regression), the difference is that, PLS also choose what the component is to predict Y, just as ordinary linear regression. 5. LARS - Least Angle regressionIt’s an algorithm for computing linear regression with L1 regularization(Lasso).Big idea: Move coef along the most correlated feature until another feature becomes more correlated. Start with all coef 0 Find feature x_i most correlated with y Increase corresponding b_i, take along residual r. Stop when some x_j has much correlation with r as x_i Increase (b_i, b_j) in their joint least square direction, until some other x_m has much correlation with r. If a non-zero coef hits 0, remove it from the active set of features and recompute the joint direction. Continue until all features are in the model.Generally speaking, it is a forward selection algorithm implemented in Lasso mode. I’ll talk about Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet regularizations in another article. 6. ALS - Alternative Least SquareUsed in collaborative filtering, powerful technique in building recommendation systems.Here we want UV to be as close to R as possible, since U, V are too low rank, a perfect solution will be impossible. But it’s actually a good thing, which will reduce the iteration rounds of ALS.General idea of ALS: Fix one matrix to optimize another, and do iterations. It’s just like EM algorithm, our objective function here is the loss(difference) between LHS and RHS. I’ll talk about collaborative filtering along with recommendation system and RSA next time.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2017%2F03%2F09%2FProposal%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This work is under guidance of Professor Saravanan Kesavan in UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School. Given a retailer’s data across 123 stores through 47 weeks, we want to apply the Newsvendor model to estimate service level for managers in each store. Further research will be, to discover what kind of factors are affecting manager service level. 1. Newsvendor Model General SummaryE[Profit] = E[p*min(q, D)-cq]Here c, p is the fixed cost and price for each unit of demand, q is the number of units stocked(q* will be the best decision we make about inventory amount, it is what we’re interested in). D is a random variable with CDF F representing demand.The solution q satisfy: F(q)= (p-c)/p Starting from the very basic case above, in our research, the newsvendor problem assumes only overage and underage costs (denoted C_o and C_u, respectively). It’s not hard to see that C_o ~ c, C_u ~ (p-c). Thus F(Q*)=1/(1+C_o/C_u). The ratio is referred to as “Service Level”. Notes: Derivation of the result. Take the expectation of the loss as our objective function L, we want to minimize it. Let Q be the inventory amount, x is the real demand.(R.V.). Then the loss will be: l1(Q, x) = (Q - x)C_o, if x&lt;=Q l2(Q, x) = (x - Q)C_u, if x&gt;QNow the objective function is L(Q) = Int_x_0_Q( l1(Q, x)*f(x) ) + Int_x_Q_inf( l2(Q, x)*f(x) ), let L’(Q) = 0, we will get the result shown above. 2. How We’ll Apply the ModelDifferent from direct application, a twist in this research is that we’re interested in the “best labor spend”(i.e the money spent on labor) for each store, rather than the inventory amount. In the standpoint of a store manager, similar to inventory, overly or underly arrange the labor than the real need will bring loss. Therefore, the service level of a manager measures his/her labor arrangement strategy. For each week, the labor_goal column in the data refers to the labor cost planned to be made based on the actual sale data, and actual_labor refers to the actual optimized labor cost L*. Thus, if we can get the labor cost distribution F(l), given the known L*, we can calculate the service level directly. Now problem comes to how can we find the labor cost distribution? The idea is, given that we’re able to find the demand distribution, and if we know some relationship between the demand distribution and labor distribution, then we can find the labor distribution as well. The connection here is made by Budget Function, it takes the actual labor as input and labor goal as output. This function is a measure of “how much you should have spent on labor” given the actual sale. Notes: Demand is completely measured by sale, thus we’re not distinguishing the two concepts. Demand is a random variable, and we’re assuming demand ~ sale forecast + random noise, thus we’re going to find the pattern of random noise in the first place. The sale forecast is measured by the sales_manageradj column. 3. Steps To Go First thing to do is finding the demand distribution F(x) for each store. Given the labor_goal data, and sale data, find the labor budget function B. Using demand distribution + budget function, get the labor distribution F(l) Using the given L* to find service level for each store(manager). Find factors that affect the service level.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2017%2F03%2F08%2FTensor%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Struggling with the second project of the Udacity course, image classification, it’s a key point to understand the process as a whole. Starting with: 1. What is a tensor?First of all, consider everything in a graph mode. TensorFlow is a programming system in which you represent computations as graphs. Nodes in the graph are called ops ( operations). An op takes zero or more Tensors, performs some computation, and produces zero or more Tensors. A Tensor is a typed multi-dimensional array. For example, you can represent a mini-batch of images as a 4-D array of floating point numbers with dimensions [batch, height, width, channels] Then we can claim: TensorFlow ~ Tensor + Flow I.e. tensors (units of array-like data) flowing through nodes (different kinds of operations, inner product, sigmoid, softmax, relu, etc), all the nodes forms a neural network graph. Demo of a small NN. 2. What is a session?12$ sess = tf.Session()$ sess.run(x, feed_dict=&#123;~&#125;) It’s actually bringing the graph framework into implementation. On the other hand, like the lazy computation of Spark RDDs, tf.placeholder() simply allocates a block of memory for future use in sess.run(), thus the computation graph/pipeline can be built ahead of any real data flow. Example of some commands that are part of the graph: 123$ input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None, h, w, d))$ filter_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal((H, W, in_d, out_d)))$ bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(conv_num_outputs)) 12345$ conv_layer = tf.nn.conv2d(input, weight, strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding='SAME')$ conv_layer = tf.nn.bias_add(conv_layer, bias)$ conv_layer = tf.nn.relu(conv_layer)$ conv_layer = tf.nn.max_pool( conv_layer, ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1], strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding='SAME')$ session.run(optimizer, feed_dict=&#123;x: feature_batch, y: label_batch, keep_prob: keep_probability&#125;) 3. Why CNN? Regular neural nets: nodes in a single layer are independent, will generate huge scale of weights. Full connectivity is a waste of “adjacent” info, number of parameters lead to overfitting. The depth of filter is just like different nodes in a single layer.(To capture different levels of info) Number of filters ~ depth of filters For the same filter (same depth), share all parameters. Example: Input shape 32x32x3 (H, W, D_Channel) 20 filters of shape 8x8x3, stride 2, padding 1. Output shape -&gt; 14x14x20 No P sharing: (8x8x3+1)x(14x14x20) With P sharing: (8x8x3+1)x20]]></content>
